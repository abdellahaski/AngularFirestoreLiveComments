This project was first created in 2019, as a part of an Android Application (an unofficial app for a comedy competition TV Show), and allowed users of the Android app to comment and see other's comments in realtime.

It was first built on Angular V8 and later **rebuilt** from scratch on the latest (as of 2022) **Angular V14**.

The project uses the magic of Firebase **Firestore** to show and add comments in realtime across all connected users.

A moderation feature was integreted that allow a moderator to see hide unwanted comments.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
